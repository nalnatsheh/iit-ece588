# ECE 588 - Hardware Acceleration for ML
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Purpose:** This page was created to host any related handouts/tutorials for the course **ECE 588 - Hardware Acceleration for ML** taught by [Prof. Kyuwon Ken Choi](http://www.ece.iit.edu/~vlsida/people.html) at Illinois Institute of Technology.

**Acknowledgments:** Many thanks to the ECE Department for providing us with 12 PYNQ-Z2 FPGA boards, and special thanks to Dr. Yi, who helped in this whole setup. 

Below is an image of the 12 PYNQ-Z2 FPGA boards located in DA LAB (SH309).
